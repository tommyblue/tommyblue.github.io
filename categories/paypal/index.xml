      <description>In my last work, Agrim√®.it, an ecommerce built using Ruby on rails, I had to implement the cart payment using Paypal Express Checkout.
Sadly, I found that was the worst time to do it, because Paypal was migrating the classic API to the new REST API and the documentation was a real mess! Walking through the doc links, I jumped (without a particular logic) from the new to the old API reference and vice versa.</description>

      <description>If you deploy a rails app forgetting to configure logs automatic rotation, few weeks later won&amp;rsquo;t be difficult to find something like this:
$ ls -lh log/production.log -rw-rw-r-- 1 www-data www-data 93,2M apr 10 17:49 production.log Think if you have to find some error log inside a 100MB file, not easy&amp;hellip; :)
Setting log rotation isn&amp;rsquo;t difficult at all. I know two main ways.
Use syslog This is a really easy solution.</description>

      <description>In my last work, Agrim√®.it, an ecommerce built using Ruby on rails, I had to implement the cart payment using Paypal Express Checkout.
Sadly, I found that was the worst time to do it, because Paypal was migrating the classic API to the new REST API and the documentation was a real mess! Walking through the doc links, I jumped (without a particular logic) from the new to the old API reference and vice versa.</description>
